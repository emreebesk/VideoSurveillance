# VideoSurveillance
You will need a camera like a webcam (built-in or a USB one) that is attached to your server where you will be running an HTTP server (e.g., Apache or NGINX). The goal is to capture real-time video, encode it and store it on the server. Viewers using a Web client (in the browser) should be able to connect to the server and watch the live video.
